# Introduction to Git
_A version control system for tracking changes in computer files._

## What Is Git?
- A **distributed version control system** (DVCS)
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
- Enables collaboration and tracking changes in files over time

## Why Use Git?
- **Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can work on the same project.
- **Version History**: Easily review, revert, or compare different versions.
- **Branching & Merging**: Isolate new features and then integrate them seamlessly.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for creating branches and snapshots.

## How Git Works
1. **Working Directory**: Your local set of files.
2. **Staging Area** (Index): The list of changes you want to commit.
3. **Local Repository**: Your private database of commits.
4. **Remote Repository**: A shared repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) for collaboration.

## Key Git Concepts
- **Commit**: A snapshot of the repository at a specific time.
- **Branch**: A parallel line of development. 
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Pull**: Fetch the latest changes from remote and merge them locally.
- **Push**: Send your local commits to the remote repository.
- **Clone**: Copy an entire remote repository to your local machine.


## Basic Git Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repo_url>`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git status`: Show the state of the working directory and staging area.
- `git add <file>`: Stage file changes for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "Message"`: Commit staged changes with a message.
- `git push`: Upload your local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge the latest changes from remote.

## Common Git Workflows
1. **Feature Branch Workflow**:
   - Create a branch for each feature or bug fix.
   - Merge (or rebase) into main/master when done.
2. **Fork & Pull Request** (used in open-source):
   - Fork a project.
   - Make changes in your fork.
   - Create a pull request to merge into the original repository.
3. **GitFlow**:
   - Structured approach with develop, release, and hotfix branches.
   - Often used for larger projects with formal release cycles.


## Useful Features & Tips
- **Stashing**: Temporarily save unfinished work (`git stash`).
- **Tagging**: Mark specific commits (e.g., version releases).
- **Rebase**: Rewrite commit history for cleaner, linear history.
- **Hooks**: Automate tasks at certain stages (e.g., pre-commit checks).
- **GUI Tools**: Git clients like GitKraken, Sourcetree, or VS Code built-in Git.
- **Ignore files**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude files from version control.
